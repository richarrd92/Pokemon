# Pokemon_Battle

As part of a team of four, we developed a web-based game named "Pokémon Battle" using a combination of PHP, SQL, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Our project was centered around creating an engaging and interactive game where Pokémon battle for supremacy. Here's a detailed breakdown of our work:

**Frontend Development:** We utilized HTML and CSS to craft an intuitive and visually appealing user interface. This included designing various game screens, such as the battle arena and menus, ensuring a seamless user experience.

**Game Functionality:** JavaScript was employed to implement the core functionalities of the game. This encompassed player interactions, Pokémon movements, battle mechanics, and animations. We also added audio effects to enhance the gameplay experience.

**Backend and Database Management:** PHP and SQL were used to handle data storage and retrieval. We set up a MariaDB database to store Pokémon data, including attributes, stats, and images. PHP scripts were written to manage game logic, database interactions, and server-side processing.

**Collaboration and Version Control: **GitHub was instrumental in facilitating our team collaboration. We used it for version control, allowing us to work on different parts of the project simultaneously and merge our contributions efficiently.

**Customization and Creativity:** We added custom animations and backgrounds to make the game more engaging. The game features base and special attacks, team battles, and random elements to keep the gameplay exciting.

This project showcased our ability to integrate various web technologies, manage a database, and work effectively as a team to deliver a functional and entertaining web-based game.
